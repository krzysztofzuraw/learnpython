Learn Python
===========

This repository is for my python learning projects.

In this README file I will link each project that I finish or I'm working at.

[**Alarm Clock**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/alarm/Alarm/alarm.py)- A simple clock where it return "End" after X number of hours/minutes/seconds

[**Bank Account Manager**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/bank/Bank/bank.py)- Create a class called Account which will be an abstract class for three other classes called CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount and BusinessAccount. Manage credits and debits from these accounts through an ATM style program

[**Credit Card Validator**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/card_validator/card_validator/validator.py)- Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (using LUHN algorithm).

[**Caesar cipher**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/cezar/Cezar/cezar_cipher.py)- Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding.

[**Change Return Program**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/change/Change/change.py)- The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of zlotys for the change. 

[**E to n-digit**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/eToN/eToN/eton.py)- Calculate iterations of e using Newton Series Expansion

[**Fibonacci sequence**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/fibonacci/Fibonacci/fibonacci.py)- Generate fibonacci sequence to n place

[**Fizz Buzz**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/fizzbuzz/FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.py)- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

[**Country from IP Lookup**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/lookup/Lookup/lookup.py)- Simple website ip and ip information from whois'

[**Random name generator**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/nameGenerator/NameGenerator/generator.py)- Random name generator

[**Pi to n-digit**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/pinN/Pi/piton.py)- Calculate n iterations of Archimedes PI recurrence relation

[**Prime Factorization**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/primeFactor/primeFactor/primefactor.py)- Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

[**Regex query**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/regex/RegexQuery/regex_query.py)- Regex query tool with tk gui

[**Reverse String and Number**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/reverseString/reverseString/reverse.py)- Reverse string and number

[**Rock Paper Scissors game**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/rockPaperScissors/HandGame/handGame.py)

[**Page scraper**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/scraper/Scraper/scraper.py)- Simple page scraper that get urls and title from web page

[**Merge and Insertion sorting alogrithms**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/sorting/Sorting/sorting.py)

[**Temperature converter**](https://github.com/Noaal/learnpython/blob/master/temperatureConv/converter/converter.py)- Converting between: Celcius, Kalvin and Farenheit
